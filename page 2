    Dear Readers,

The word 'Divyang', given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi eight years ago for changing the mental perception of the society and in the direction of Accessible India Campaign, has become a resolution of the new India. Be it industry or sports, disabled people are writing the dimensions of success in every field. The vision of the Central Government is to provide not only mental, physical and social facilities but also equal opportunities to the specially abled persons. The government has made unprecedented progress in this direction.
The featured cover story in the latest edition of New India Samachar (1-15 December, 2023) delves into the theme of 'Accessible India, Empowered Society’. Noteworthy among the articles is a special feature titled 'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ offering insights into the transformative journey of developed Bharat.
For easy accessibility, the e-New India Samachar is now available in Hindi,English, and 11 other Indian languages. Click on the link in your preferred language to explore the latest edition and stay informed about the dynamic developments shaping the nation.
Best wishes and Regards
